This project is hosted on Replit as a part of my curiosity and contains several main files.

Main files include:
- main.py
- data.json
- dataHandler.py



To host it on your own, upload these files and put up a Secret Environment on the project as follows:

Key   -> FLASK_DEBUG

Value -> production

(Note: this may be deprecated anytime in the future)
